But what's this? This is not a room you recognise. In place of a soft mattress is the cold hotel bathroom floor you passed out on. You stumble towards the window and see the vast city of Bangkok, Thailand, stretching out beyond the horizon. Confusion and panic sets in. You feel nauseous. What do you do?",
